# chunkwm-alfred - Alfred Workflow for [ChunkWM](https://github.com/koekeishiya/chunkwm)

[ChunkWM](https://github.com/koekeishiya/chunkwm) is an amazing Tiling Window Manager for MacOS. The one thing that it lacks is a dedicated Hotkeying System. [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) (with the Powerpack) provides exactly that.  This is a relatively basic Workflow which triggers many of the basic ChunkWM commands, allowing you to, with a single keystroke, move windows, resize them, disable/restart ChunkWM, and change layouts.

Of course, your keystrokes will vary, and mine are arranged for a [Hyper Key](https://brettterpstra.com/2017/06/15/a-hyper-key-with-karabiner-elements-full-instructions/) based workflow (where [Karabiner](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/) is used to remap Capslock to `Ctrl+Option+Cmd+Shift`, which allows most keys on the keyboard to be repurposed as alternative commands.

Enjoy!
